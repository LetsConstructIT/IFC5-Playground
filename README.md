# IFC5-Playground

Hands-on experience with new technology provides the most reliable basis for evaluating its merits and capabilities.

Recently there has been a lot of talk about work on the new IFC5 format. Its relationship with [USD](https://openusd.org/), modular structure, file-independence, JSON-focused, etc.

This repository is my first attempt to read IFC5 file (you can find them in [IFC5-development](https://github.com/buildingSMART/IFC5-development) repo). But just reading files is not enough, as humans rely heavily on sight to process and evaluate information beyond just reading text. So I have created simple Rhino importer to display IFC5 file content.

All samples are in C#, .NET 7 with possiblity to downgrade to Framework 4.8.
